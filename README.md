# General

Microsofts MSFS SDK Sample GaugeAircraft in Rust ðŸ¦€

Because I didn't want to write logic in Microsoft's cursed RPN language, XML or C++.

# Requirements
1. Git for Windows (with Git Bash)
1. Rust
1. MSFS SDK

# Developing

### Compile the Rust logic
1. `cd Sources/Rust`
1. `cargo build -v --target wasm32-wasip1 --release && wasm-opt -O1 --signext-lowering --enable-bulk-memory -o ../../../../../Packages/mycompany-aircraft-wasm-gauge/SimObjects/Airplanes/MyCompany_Gauge_Aircraft/panel/nvg_demo.wasm target/wasm32-wasip1/release/nvg_demo.wasm`

### Open project in MSFS
1. Enable MSFS developer mode
1. File -> Open Project -> open the rust_aircraft.xml project file in this repo
1. Debug -> Console
1. Disable the "Autoset" checkbox in the top right of the console and disable any filters
1. Editors -> Project Editor
1. Clear all messages in Console
1. Press the "Build All" button in the Project Editor
1. Search for the "Gauge Aircraft" to fly

### Updating code
1. Change something in the Rust code and build using the command above
1. Project Manager: File -> close project (optional but makes reload way faster)
1. Tools -> Behaviours
1. In the Behaviours window: "Quick reload" (rebuilds the project if it wasn't closed before. Rebuild only required if file naming or project structure changes)

### Checking WASM state
1. Start a flight with the "GaugeAicraft" that should now be available in the sim
1. Debug -> Display WASM Debug Window
1. Select the .wasm file from the dropdown
